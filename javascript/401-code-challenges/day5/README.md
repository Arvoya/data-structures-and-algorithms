# Linked List

## Approach & Efficiency

We had a wonderful lecture going over linked lists and how they work. I was able
to follow along and understand the concepts. I was able to implement the linked
list and the tests with ease. I was able to get the tests to pass and the linked
list to work as expected.

## Tests

- Can successfully instantiate an empty linked list
- Can properly insert into the linked list
- The head property will properly point to the first node in the linked list
- Can properly insert multiple nodes into the linked list
- Will return true when finding a value within the linked list that exists
- Will return false when searching for a value in the linked list that does not
exist.
- Can properly return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
